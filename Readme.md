Kastle is a multi-chain wallet that makes it possible to onboard onto every supported chain in less than a minute. Simply deposit funds into our “gas tank” via card, bank, or crypto and use those funds to pay for gas for any transaction on any supported chain. Using Kastle, you will no longer need to spend hours bridging between chains, paying exorbitant transaction fees to 3rd parties, or doing KYC with companies like Moonpay. You will quickly be able to use any compatible dapp on any supported chain.
